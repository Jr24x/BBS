TELEGARD 3.02 RELEASED - TELEGARD 3.01 &
PREVIOUS SECURITY PROBLEMS FOUND
     
MISSISSAUGA, ON -- July 14, 1996 -- Telegard 3.02 has been released to 
replace Telegard 3.01 and previous versions with major security problems.
     
Depending on your system setup (and many different combinations of 
settings), you are susceptible to this attack.  Telegard 3.02 patches up 
that big problem (also includes several minor fixes).
      
Telegard 3.02 should be installed over all previous Telegard 2.99/3.00 
versions-- while 3.02 is largely untested (the next release was to be 
3.10), it is extremely important that you secure your system.  Please 
remove Telegard 3.01 & previous versions immediately (delete them from your 
file sections as well).

Systems running 3.00/3.01 with PWE are at least more secure than those 
without PWE.  However, even with PWE enabled, this loophole is still 
dangerous.
     

SECURE YOUR SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY

This information has been made public by an irresponsible invidual.  It is 
vital you make the following changes to your configuration this very 
instant (these are COMMON SENSE settings for most situations):

         SysOp SL: S255XL
       CoSysOp SL: S255XL

Then download Telegard 3.02, and install over top of your current 
configuration.
     
     
MY GENERAL COMMENTS
     
This problem has existed for several public versions (i.e. neither the beta 
team nor the general public have found the problem till now).  The fact 
that it is only presently surfacing is a good indication that the problem 
is few and far between.
     
That aside, I can only apologize for the problem.  I have done my best to 
ensure that such problems don't occur, and that when they do, they are 
promptly fixed.  Such is the case with this problem-- I found out about it 
an hour ago, and a solution is available -now-.

I am human, and I can make mistakes.  I make no apologies for either.  If 
you can't accept that fact, don't make any negative comments, don't 
complain -- quite frankly -- just don't say anything about this at all.
     
I am angry at myself for allowing this problem to slip through-- I don't 
need anyone else harping on the issue.  I've met with my fair share of 
ungrateful people over the last seven years, so I respectfully request you 
don't make me regret my decision to continue Telegard . . .
     
If you're not satisfied with my efforts with Telegard and to stop problems 
like this from occurring, please delete your entire Telegard directory.
     
     
TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PUBLICLY RELEASED THIS INFORMATION

I only wish that you had thought about it a little more first.  Now dozens 
of systems are potentially at risk -- unknowingly -- and the solution can't 
hit their systems before the problem does.
       
I would have credited you with finding the problem.  Instead, I now credit 
you with creating and helping to manifest the problem.  While it has led to 
a solution (thankfully), your tactfulness in dealing with what is 
potentially a big problem has left a lot to desired. 
       
What I really want you to understand is how inappropriate it is to post 
such information publicly -- especially while the problem is not widespread 
and a quick-fix solution can be recommended and distributed promptly, and 
WITHOUT endangering other systems.
         
I'm not really angry, just mighty disappointed.

Tim
