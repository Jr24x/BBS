     INTRODUCTION

       Telegard 3.0 is finally here!

       Telegard 3.02 is a major bug fix release to patch up some run-time
       code with a security loophole.  3.02 should be immediately installed
       on your system (see PRESS.302 for further details).

       Telegard 3.01 is a minor bug fix release to patch up some run-time
       code which was generating problems.  3.01 also fixes a number of
       other prominent problems, and should *definately* be installed over
       3.00.

       While it has been 3+ years since the last official Telegard release, 
       I'm proud to say that this version is a worthy successor to Telegard 
       2.7.  It is my first official release as author of the software, and 
       I hope that the wait was worth the effort that was placed into 
       Telegard by myself and my entire development team (past & present).

       Please print INSTALL.DOC and follow the instructions as outlined
       *exactly*.  If you do not do this, I guarentee problems (don't skip
       steps, don't just jump in -- READ THE DOCS, THEY ARE NOT FOR MY 
       HEALTH!)
       
     CREDITS

       Thanks to my entirely deserving beta team, and especially to Michael 
       Yadron and my new cohorts, Kevin Watkins and Don Johnson.
         
           Michael Yadron, who has recently retired from active duty on the
           beta team, deserves more thanks than I can ever express to him.
           His hard work, as the organizer, the co-ordinator, the motivator 
           and just about everything else that he was and is, kept things 
           going in the right direction and our release would not have been 
           made without him.  Mike, I wish you the best of luck and yes, 
           I will talk to you soon. :)

           For those of you who have missed their active participation in
           TG_SUPPORT, I would like everyone to give a warm welcome to the
           individuals who are replacing Mike in their new expanded 
           positions -- Don Johnson and Kevin Watkins.  They have rather
           big feet to fill in Michael's absense and with all their new
           job duties too, but I'm more than confident that they will do an 
           excellent job!  Kudos guys . . .

           Thanks also to Kevin Watkins for producing (under duress) the 
           TELEGARD.DOC documentation included with this release.  It's a
           task that I wouldn't have wanted, and I'm more-than-glad that
           he did them . . . :)

           Other members of my beta team have come and gone with time - to
           all the present and past members of the team, a heartfelt 
           thanks.  Beyond all the ideas you provide, you're really just
           a great group of people to work with.

       So thanks again for all your patience.  We hope you enjoy this
       Telegard release.

       Regards, Tim Strike
