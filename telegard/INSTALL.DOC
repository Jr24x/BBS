       INTRODUCTION
       
       Welcome to Telegard Bulletin Board Software, version 3.02.  This 
       documentation contains quick instructions for installing Telegard 
       for the first time, or for completing an upgrade from previous 
       versions of the Telegard software.
       
       Please read README.DOC before continuing with this installation.

       Please read these instructions very carefully.  The steps we have 
       outlined are designed to ensure that you install our system with
       minimal effort and with success the FIRST time!

       If you are upgrading from a previous version of Telegard, you should 
       refer to the section titled "UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS", otherwise if you 
       are a first time user of Telegard, please follow the "NEW 
       INSTALLATION" section.

       PKZIP VERSION NOTES

       Our package is released with PKZIP version 2.04g.  This is the 
       latest publically available version of PKZIP as of June 29, 1996.

       There are several hacked versions of PKZIP 1.10 going around which
       have versions in the 3.nn and 4.nn series of numbers.  PKZIP 1.10
       and subsequently these hacked versions, are *not* compatible with
       the encryption method used in 2.04g and in the file INSTALL.TG.


       NEW INSTALLATION

       1)  Create a new directory for your Telegard BBS

       2)  Copy INSTALL.TG into the new directory

       3)  Type "PKUNZIP INSTALL.TG -sONLYRAINS" at the DOS command prompt, 
           without the quotes.  This will extract the necessary install
           files for your system.

       4)  Type "TELEGARD" at the DOS command prompt, without the quotes.  
           This will start the installation process.  We will ask you a few 
           simple questions regarding the placement of the remaining data 
           files.  You should configure these directories in such a manner 
           that the directory structure is not obvious (i.e. do not use 
           /DATA/ as your data directory).

       5)  The installation process will build the desired directory 
           structure, unpack the enclosed data files, and create any other
           data files which are needed for BBS installation.

       6)  Run "INDEX BUILD ALL" from the main /bbs/ directory to create
           the index files as required by the system.

       7)  From your main bbs directory run "MAKELANG .\LANGUAGE\ENGLISH"
           to compile your new language file (Note: Replace \LANGUAGE\ with
           your correct language path).                                  

       8)  Run "TELEGARD -?" to familiarize yourself with the commands 
           available from the command line.

       9)  Run "TELEGARD -L" to load the BBS locally -- Hit "ESC" for the
           menu commands available -- Use the System Configuration and
           System Manager commands to setup the remainder of your BBS
           system (remember to change the information in the first user
           record to your OWN personal information!).

       10) You may delete INSTALL.TG and *.TWS after the installation has 
           been completed.  These files are only temporary installation 
           files and are not used in the general operation of the BBS.  You 
           should save a copy of the original archive (TG_nnn@n.ZIP) in 
           case you want or need to reinstall the software at a later date.

           You can also delete the UPGRADE.EXE file, which is only used if
           upgrading from a previous gamma of Telegard.

       11) Remember to read RELEASE.DOC at some point in the near future.


       UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS

       If you are upgrading from Telegard 2.7, please refer to the section
       immediately following this text.  If you are upgrading from a 
       gamma release of Telegard 3.0, please skip to the section for gamma
       upgrades.

       
       TELEGARD 2.7 UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
       
       The differences between Telegard 2.7 and Telegard 3.0 are quite 
       profound.  We suggest that you take the upgrade slowly and tackle
       it over a couple of days to ensure that you get the upgrade right
       before putting your new 3.0 system online.
       
       To successfully upgrade from 2.7 to 3.0, you will need the archive 
       "TG_UPG32.ZIP", distributed at the same time that Telegard 3.0 was 
       distributed.  This file contains the upgrade program which is needed 
       to upgrade from Telegard 2.7.
       
       Create a backup of your 2.7 BBS system.  This will ensure you have
       a downgrade path if necessary.
       
       Telegard 3.0 should be placed in a new directory -- your old BBS
       directory will no longer be used.  This will mean that many of your
       system files will have to point towards new directories, etc.  This
       is good for two reasons; firstly, it will ensure that you use 
       software which is only compatible with Telegard 3.0, and secondly; 
       it will ensure that your system security is preserved.
       
       1)  Create a new directory for your Telegard BBS

       2)  Copy INSTALL.TG into the new directory

       3)  Type "PKUNZIP INSTALL.TG -sONLYRAINS" at the DOS command prompt, 
           without the quotes.  This will extract the necessary install
           files for your system.

       4)  Type "TELEGARD" at the DOS command prompt, without the quotes.  
           This will start the installation process.  We will ask you a few 
           simple questions regarding the placement of the remaining data 
           files.  You should configure these directories in such a manner 
           that the directory structure is not obvious (i.e. do not use 
           /DATA/ as your data directory).

       5)  The installation process will build the desired directory 
           structure, unpack the enclosed data files, and create any other
           data files which are needed for BBS installation.

       6)  Follow the remaining instructions as provided by the 
           installation process, except skip "INDEX ALL BUILD" for now.
        
       7)  You may delete INSTALL.TG and *.TWS after the installation has 
           been completed.  These files are only temporary installation 
           files and are not used in the general operation of the BBS.  You 
           should save a copy of the original archive (TG_nnn@n.ZIP) in 
           case you want or need to reinstall the software at a later date.       
       
       8)  Copy the "TG_UPG32.ZIP" file into your new directory.
       
       9)  Type "PKUNZIP TG_UPG32.ZIP" at the DOS command prompt,
           without the quotes.  This will extract the necessary upgrade
           files for your system.
           
       10) Review UPGRADE.DOC to familiarize yourself with the upgrade
           instructions.
       
       11) Type "UPGRADE" at the DOS command prompt, without the quotes.
           When prompted, input your Telegard 2.7 information and then
           follow the remaining instructions for the upgrade.

       12) Switch to your /data/ directory and type "REN CONFRENC.DAT
           GROUPS.DAT".
        
       13) Type "UPDATE" at the DOS command prompt, without the quotes.
           When prompted, select Telegard 2.7 as your upgrade path, and
           the program will do the remainder of the updates from G1 to
           G4 (if using a version of TG_UPD later than 3.2, this step
           may not be neccessary).
           
       14) Type "INDEX BUILD ALL" at the DOS command prompt, to complete
           the update of your index files.  Do this -- whether you've run
           the index build before or not, do it again!

       15) Remember to read RELEASE.DOC at some point in the near future.

           
       TELEGARD 3.0/3.01 RELEASE (final) UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
       
       1)  Copy INSTALL.TG into your BBS directory

       2)  Type "PKUNZIP INSTALL.TG -sONLYRAINS" at the DOS command prompt, 
           without the quotes.  This will extract the necessary install
           files for your system.  You should replace TELEGARD.EXE,
           TELEGARD.OVR and UNPACK.EXE as well as replace *.TWS files.

       3)  You should then run UNPACK for each of the .TWS files in order
           to update the data files that are in use on the system.  To do
           this type "UNPACK <filename> <location>" at the DOS command 
           prompt, without the quotes, replacing <filename> with the .TWS
           filename and <location> with the directory for the unpacking.
           
           Say NO to extract new/non-existant files.  You want to replace
           some files which already exist; saying NO will ensure that you
           can do that.

               FILENAME        LOCATION                  OVERWRITE?
               notes.tws       /notes/ directory            yes
               defaults.tws    data directory               yes*  
               language.tws    languages directory          yes**
               utility.tws     main bbs directory           yes
               text.tws        default text directory
               menus.tws       default menus directory
        
           *  overwrite TELEGARD.* files, MENUS.DAT and HARDWARE.DAT files.
           ** overwrite ENGLISH.TXT if you desire (this will wipe out any 
              changes that you did to your language file)
              
       4)  Run "INDEX BUILD ALL" to update your files to repair any damage 
           inadvertently caused by the previous INDEX releases and to 
           ensure your indexes are totally up-to-date.

       5)  Run UPDATE.EXE from the main BBS directory.  Select version 3.01 
           and the let the utility update your data files.

       6)  Review WHATSNEW.302 for changes done since the previous gamma.
           There will be several instructions in this file on things which
           need to be updated (i.e. language strings which are new, no
           longer used or changed, etc.).  If you replaced ENGLISH.TXT
           with the new one, you do not need to update your languages
           (except if you have other languages defined).  Remember to
           update all your languages!
       
       7)  From your main bbs directory run "MAKELANG .\LANGUAGE\ENGLISH"
           to compile your new language file (Note: Replace \LANGUAGE\ with
           your correct language path).  Repeat as neccessary for each of
           your remaining languages.

       8)  You may delete INSTALL.TG and *.TWS after the upgrade has 
           been completed, and UPDATE.EXE after it has been run (step 7).

       9)  Remember to read RELEASE.DOC at some point in the near future.

       
       TELEGARD 3.0 GAMMA (2.99.g1-2.99.g4) UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS

       1)  Copy INSTALL.TG into your BBS directory

       2)  Type "PKUNZIP INSTALL.TG -sONLYRAINS" at the DOS command prompt, 
           without the quotes.  This will extract the necessary install
           files for your system.  You should replace TELEGARD.EXE,
           TELEGARD.OVR and UNPACK.EXE as well as replace *.TWS files.

       3)  You should then run UNPACK for each of the .TWS files in order
           to update the data files that are in use on the system.  To do
           this type "UNPACK <filename> <location>" at the DOS command 
           prompt, without the quotes, replacing <filename> with the .TWS
           filename and <location> with the directory for the unpacking.
           
           Say NO to extract new/non-existant files.  You want to replace
           some files which already exist; saying NO will ensure that you
           can do that.

               FILENAME        LOCATION                  OVERWRITE?
               notes.tws       /notes/ directory            yes
               defaults.tws    data directory               yes*  
               language.tws    languages directory          yes**
               utility.tws     main bbs directory           yes
               text.tws        default text directory
               menus.tws       default menus directory
        
           *  overwrite TELEGARD.* files, MENUS.DAT and HARDWARE.DAT files.
           ** overwrite ENGLISH.TXT if you desire (this will wipe out any 
              changes that you did to your language file)
              
       4)  ONLY IF UPGRADING DIRECTLY FROM GAMMA-1 TO GAMMA-3:

             (i)  Switch to your /data/ directory and execute "COPY 
                  CONFRENC.DAT GROUPS.DAT" (this will copy your conference 
                  file to the new filename; the old one is kept just for 
                  backwards compatibility until utilities which use it can 
                  be completely updated).

             (ii) From your main bbs directory run "INDEX QWK RENUMBER" 
                  (this fixes problems caused by the previous INDEX 
                  release).

       5)  Run "INDEX BUILD ALL" to update your files to repair any damage 
           inadvertently caused by the previous INDEX releases and to 
           ensure your indexes are totally up-to-date.

       6)  If upgrading from gamma-1 or gamma-2, copy your CONFIG.TG file 
           to a backup (CONFIG.BAK) and copy your /data/NETWORK.DAT file to 
           a backup (NETWORK.BAK)

       7)  Run UPDATE.EXE from the main BBS directory.  Select the version 
           from which you are upgrading, and the let the utility update 
           your data files.

       8)  Review WHATSNEW.302 for changes done since the previous gamma.
           There will be several instructions in this file on things which
           need to be updated (i.e. language strings which are new, no
           longer used or changed, etc.).  If you replaced ENGLISH.TXT
           with the new one, you do not need to update your languages
           (except if you have other languages defined).  Remember to
           update all your languages!
       
       9)  From your main bbs directory run "MAKELANG .\LANGUAGE\ENGLISH"
           to compile your new language file (Note: Replace \LANGUAGE\ with
           your correct language path).  Repeat as neccessary for each of
           your remaining languages.

       10) You may delete INSTALL.TG and *.TWS after the upgrade has 
           been completed, and UPDATE.EXE after it has been run (step 7).

       11) Remember to read RELEASE.DOC at some point in the near future.
